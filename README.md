This is a metrics application that reads different types of assignments such as conditions, number of functions and the length of code in the file.

Things to do: 
1. Fix function variableCounter in metrics.js
2. Call on reader function only in app.js to prevent DRY code.
3. Fix metrics.js so it can read from different files and modules.
4. Add a test file.
5. Add more metrics functions.
